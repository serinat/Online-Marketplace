# Online-Marketplace

- In this assignment, you will be creating a marketplace that allows users to view products from Best Buy. The user will be able to view details about the product, and if they decide, add the product to a shopping cart.

## Instructions

As a customer, I want to be able to search through Best Buy's directory and add items to my shopping cart. Once I'm finished shopping, I want to be able to navigate to my shopping cart and view a short summary of the items that I purchased.

How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:

The server has already been provided for you. It will be up to you to decide how to style your application.


ðŸ”‘ In the server folder, make sure to change .env-example to .env. It is recommended that you replace the Best Buy API Key with your own key.


To run the application:

Open a tab in your terminal and run mongod.

In a separate tab, cd into server and run npm install followed by npm start.

Create your React application in a third tab and run npm start.

It is recommended that you include the following pages:

A Home page that displays "top" products. The user should be able to search for keywords.

A Shopping Cart page that displays all items in their cart. Users should be able to remove items from their cart, view a subtotal, and adjust quantities of each item in their cart.

## Hints

Try making your application functional before worrying about styling it.

It is recommended that you outline the different elements of global state your application will need before writing any code.
